# quong
QUad pONG -- Four-way pong.

## Style
`quong` will follow [PEP-008] with the following exceptions:

1. Variables and functions will be camelCased.

2. Private fields and methods will be prefixed with a single underscore.

3. Use properties instead of accessor methods, and only when necessary.

4. Because 2 of the 3 contributors to this project are masochists, tabs will be
   used over spaces.
