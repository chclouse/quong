# quong
QUad pONG -- Four-way pong.

## Dependencies
`quong` requires Python 3 and [PyGame].

## Style
~~`quong` will follow PEP-008 with the following exceptions:~~
We pretty much just do our own thing. PEP-008 compliance not ensured. However,
we do:

1. Variables and functions will be camelCased.

2. Private fields and methods will be prefixed with a single underscore.

3. Use properties instead of accessor methods, and only when necessary.

4. Because 2 of the 3 contributors to this project are masochists, tabs will be
   used over spaces.
